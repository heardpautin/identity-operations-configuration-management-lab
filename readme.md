# 🧩 IAM Tier 2 / Identity Operations & Configuration Management Evidence Lab

## 📘 Overview

This lab demonstrates **realistic Tier 2 IAM / Identity Operations skills** commonly seen in enterprise and healthcare environments.

The focus is on **identity governance support, operational access management, configuration control, and audit-ready documentation** — not deep engineering or vendor-specific tool development.

This project intentionally mirrors how IAM functions in large organizations where:

- 🧠 IGA platforms (e.g., SailPoint) perform provisioning  
- 🛡️ IAM teams **govern, validate, audit, and support identity operations**  
- ⚙️ PowerShell and configuration practices are used at an **operations and governance level**

> **Important Note**  
> All examples in this repository are **lab-based or executed in authorized environments only**.  
> No proprietary, production, or employer-specific data is included.

## 🎯 Scope & Focus Areas

This lab covers Tier 2 / 2.5 IAM responsibilities, including:

- 👤 Identity lifecycle governance (Joiner / Mover / Leaver)
- 📬 Distribution Lists & Mail-Enabled Security Groups (healthcare-style ops)
- 🔐 RBAC & least-privilege validation
- 💻 PowerShell for identity operations (light, realistic usage)
- 📋 Configuration & change management alignment
- 🗂️ Audit-ready evidence and documentation practices

## 🔄 Identity Lifecycle (JML) — Tier 2 View

### 🟢 Joiner
- Validate role alignment
- Confirm baseline access
- Ensure identity is placed in correct groups

### 🔵 Mover
- Remove legacy access
- Validate new role alignment
- Prevent permission creep and SoD issues

### 🔴 Leaver
- Confirm deprovisioning
- Validate removal from groups and distribution lists
- Ensure no orphaned access remains

**✅ What this proves**
- Understanding of IAM governance beyond provisioning
- Awareness of risk created by movers and delayed deprovisioning
- Alignment with audit and compliance expectations

---

## 📬 Distribution Lists & Group Operations (Healthcare-Relevant)

In healthcare and regulated environments, IAM teams frequently manage or validate:

- Distribution lists (clinical, operational, administrative)
- Mail-enabled security groups
- Role-based group membership

### Example Scenarios
- Adding a provider to a department DL
- Removing access when a clinician changes units
- Validating DL membership during audits

## 💻 PowerShell — Identity Operations (Lab / Authorized Environment)

> **Note:** Commands shown reflect real enterprise workflows and are executed only where authorization and scope permit.  
> Screenshots will be added after lab execution.
